# Python OOP Assignment

This project demonstrates basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python, including:

- **Class Design**: Creating custom classes (`Book`, `EBook`, `Vehicle`, `Car`, `Plane`)
- **Inheritance**: `EBook` inherits from `Book`; `Car` and `Plane` inherit from `Vehicle`
- **Encapsulation**: Use of class attributes and methods
- **Polymorphism**: Overriding the `move` method in subclasses

## Files

- `index.py`: Main Python script containing all class definitions and test code.

## How to Run

Run the script using Python:

```sh
python index.py
```

You will see output demonstrating the use of the classes and OOP principles.
